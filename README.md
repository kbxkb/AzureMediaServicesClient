# AzureMediaServicesClient


REST based client for Azure Media Services showing HTTP requests and responses to ingest, encode, dynamically package and play content back

This README shows a series of REST HTTP requests and responses performed against the Azure Media Services using the Google Chrome app Postman. It walks you through the breadth of basic Azure Media Services functionality - create an account, ingest content, encode it to your desired format using a pre-defined encoding profile, dynamically package and deliver it to a player.

Because this is not *code* per se - just a series of HTTP requests and responses, there is no code file checked into this repository. This README has everything you would need.

**DISCLAIMER**: Azure Media Services is changing very fast. These samples may not work if you are looking at them sometime in the future. I will try to keep these updated, but I can make no guarantees.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is meant for guidance and demonstration only. This is not intended to be used in production as-is.

## Common to all REST transactions below:

Instead of repeating these *notes* for each REST transaction below, clustering them together here:

1. The "Postman-Token" header is added by Chrome's Postman extension. It is not required for any of the calls
2. Some of the HTTP headers are required, some are just good practice to have. Examples do not distinguish between them
3. For operations against Azure storage (like when we are uploading a media file), consider using the 'x-ms-client-request-id' header for request logging, examples here do not use it

## Set Yourself Up for making HTTP calls to AMS:

#### Step 0 Create an Azure Media Services account using the Azure Portal

Use the Azure portal to create an Azure Media Services account, as explained [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-create-account/)

#### Step 1 - Get an access token

###### Http Request

```
POST /v2/OAuth2-13 HTTP/1.1
Host: wamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 120
Expect: 100-continue
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: 25a3c853-d004-b0d4-2c52-a7e2fb4d3745

grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=testams&client_secret={{your_url_encoded_ams_key_here}}&scope=urn%3AWindowsAzureMediaServices
```

##### Http Response

```
{
"token_type": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2009/11/swt-token-profile-1.0",
"access_token": "http%3a%2f%2fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2fws%2f2005%2f05%2fidentity%2fclaims%2fnameidentifier=testams&urn%3aSubscriptionId=21bb6118-8aa3-4408-adbb-b057912c24b6&http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2faccesscontrolservice%2f2010%2f07%2fclaims%2fidentityprovider=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&Audience=urn%3aWindowsAzureMediaServices&ExpiresOn=1432165204&Issuer=https%3a%2f%2fwamsprodglobal001acs.accesscontrol.windows.net%2f&HMACSHA256=lWkRuaUeKz%2bTcDoD4zC9DGthFpSwhkiZrBQgGlgj4Vg%3d",
"expires_in": "21600",
"scope": "urn:WindowsAzureMediaServices"
}
```

##### Notes

1. Value of 'client_id' in request body is your Azure Media Services account name - retrieve it from the Azure Portal using the 'Manage Keys' button
2. Value of 'client_secret' in request body is *_URL encoded_* your Azure Media Services key - retrieve it from the Azure Portal using the 'Manage Keys' button
3. Value of 'access_token' in response is time sensitive, see the 'expires_in' item in response, which is in seconds. You will need this access token in ALL calls to Azure Media Services below. As you navigate through these samples, if the token expires, you will have to repeat this step to generate a fresh access token to continue, and use the fresh token for subsequent calls
4. Consistent with the Content-Type header, note that the value of 'scope' in the request body is also URL encoded. In fact, the entire request body must be URL encoded

#### Step 2 - Connect to AMS using the token to (a) discover metadata to test the token out (b) get the cloud service URL for subsequent calls

##### Notes

1. Though you sent this request to 'media.windows.net', you should not send subsequent requests to AMS to this host. You should use the hostname returned in this response ('wamsbluclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net' in this example) from here on
2. The value of the 'Authorization' header uses the access token. Note the word 'Bearer' followed by a space must precede the access token. Also note that if the access token has expired, you will have to re-issue a new one by repeating Step 1

## Create an AMS 'Asset' and associated resources:

#### Step 3 - Create an Asset

}
```

###### Notes

1. Note that we are using the hostname we received in Step 2 from here on
2. You can use the latest (as of this writing, May 2015) values of 'DataServiceVersion' and 'MaxDataServiceVersion' - '3.0'. In this example, certain older values are used
3. You can use the latest (as of this writing, May 2015) value of 'x-ms-version' - '2.9'. In this example, 2.8, on older value, is used. Be aware that functionalities change between these API versions. An example known to work with one version is not guaranteed to work with another API version
4. This call creates an AMS 'Asset' resource for you. It is empty after creation. The 'Uri' in response gives us the resource identifier for this Asset. Note that this Uri actually uses an *_Azure Storage Account_* name as its fqdn. This is the storage account name you specified when creating the Azure Media Services account. Also note that the part after the fqdn is actually the name of a blob container created in the storage account
5. At this stage, you can go back to the portal, browse to Storage, list your containers and see this newly created container representing the AMS Asset
6. The REQUEST body shown here is minimal. There are other things you can specify, for a complete list see the [REST API reference for Azure Media Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh973617.aspx). Specifically, all properties of the Asset entity are listed [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh974277.aspx#asset_entity_properties) - an interesting one is 'Options', whose default value is 0 (meaning that the asset will not be encrypted) - that is what we have used here. You can have values of 1, 2 or 4 specifying different encryption schemes. If you encrypt your asset, you will have to call several other REST API-s not shown in this tutorial to enable its delivery and decryption
7. Make a note of the 'Id' in the response. We will be using this several times below when we update or refer to this asset during subsequent operations

4. This call creates an AMS 'AssetFile' resource for you and associates that with the 'Asset' object created in Step 3. This happens because you specify the id of the asset created in step 3 ('Id' field from Step 3's response) in the 'ParentAssetId' field of this Request
5. Make a note of the 'Id' in the response. We will be using this below when we update the metadata later

###### Notes

1. An access policy is required to create a Locator. A Locator is required to get an upload URL that we will use to upload our media file. We will create a Locator next
2. Note that the access policy will be in effect until it expires - and we specify the duration in minutes in the REQUEST JSON
3. Note that the 'Permissions' field in REQUEST JSON has possible values of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 - please see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974297.aspx#accesspolicy_properties) for the API reference and all possible values/meanings
4. Make a note of the 'Id' in the response. We will be using this when we refer to this access policy in subsequent calls

#### Step 6 - Create a Locator of Type 1 (SAS) for uploading a media file:

###### Notes

1. This step is necessary to construct the actual upload URL that we will use to upload our content file to AMS. The 'Path' and 'BaseUri' elements in the RESPONSE JSON will help us create the actual upload URL next
2. Note that in the REQUEST JSON, we are specifying the 'AccessPolicyId' from the 'Id' field in the response from Step 5, and 'AssetId' from the 'Id' field in the response from Step 3
3. Note that in the REQUEST JSON, we are specifying 'StartTime'. In order to avoid confusion, you can use UTC time and append a 'Z' to the time string - like this (see Step 16 to below see an example of a time stamp that uses 'Z'): "2015-05-17T22:00:00Z". Note that this can be (and should be, unless you have a reason to create a locator that you want to be activated in the future) a time in the past. If you use the exact current time, your locator may not be active until a few minutes, because Azure servers are not time-synced with your machine
4. Note that in the REQUEST JSON, we are specifying 'Type' as 1 - see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974308.aspx#locator_entity_properties) for all possible values and meanings. In short, use 1 for SAS type of locators, and use 2 for On Demand type of locators
5. The 'Id' field in the RESPONSE JSON gives the locator's id
6. We will use the 'Path' field in this RESPONSE JSON to construct the upload URL and access Azure Blob Storage next

## Upload your media file:

#### Step 7 - Upload a media file to the blob storage associated with the AMS account:

###### Http Request

```

```

###### Http Response

```
{{No response body, just 201 created}}
```

###### Notes

1. This is a request to Azure storage (as opposed to Azure Media Services, which all other calls in this tutorial are)
2. See all supported request headers [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179451.aspx) - in the section 'Request Headers (Block and Page Blobs'
3. The upload URL is constructed from the 'Path' field of the response from Step 6 (where we created the locator). Drop everything from '?' onwards, just take the URL without query strings. Append "/" and then the name of the MP4 file (e.g., "/koushik.mp4" above)
4. The value of x-ms-version header should be the value of "sv" query string parameter from the "Path" field of the response from Step 6 (where we created the locator)
5. The value of Content-Length header should be the exact size of the MP4 file in bytes
6. The Authorization header is of the format "Authorization=[SharedKey|SharedKeyLite] {{AccountName}}:{{Signature}}" (see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179428.aspx)), where we have used the SharedKey algorithm in this example. The Accountname is the storage account name from the fqdn (without the '.blob.core.windows.net' part)
7. The value of the signature inside the Authorization Header needs to be calculated as per guidance [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179428.aspx) - however, the guidance can quickly get pretty confusing. Hence, I am going to show a more straightforward way here
8. In order to get the signature inside the Authorization header, use this Power Shell script. It has no dependencies, no snap-ins required, just run it after changing the hardcoded values to whatever they are in your case - see the next point for a detailed description of what to change and how to use it. It will print out 2 things - The UTC time and the signature. Copy the UTC time in the "Date" and "x-ms-date" headers, and copy the signature into the Authorization header after the colon
9. Power shell script to output date and signture (this script implements the steps described [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179428.aspx) - sections 'Specifying the Authorization Header' and 'Constructing the Signture String'):

	[System.Convert]::ToBase64String($hmac.ComputeHash($dataToMac))
}

$accountName = "testamsstorage"
$accountKey = "r7g8b6tgYYG9K4i7c3bX0FdFykpOpJ0e1n4GSa2yHWs1ddCKdSfhxKK06wxxGaymsI91eSLMDvVR7UMdo68WJQ=="

$fileSize = "10498677"
$ContentTypeHeader = "application/octet-stream"

$timeNow = [System.DateTime]::UtcNow.ToString("R")
$authHeader = Generate-AuthString -requestUtcTime $timeNow -containerAndBlobPath $resourcePath -accountName $accountName -accountKey $accountKey -contentLength $fileSize -contentType $ContentTypeHeader

Write-Output $timeNow
Write-Output $authHeader
```
- How to use this Power Shell script:
  - Replace the value of the variable $accountName with your STORAGE account name. Hint: Your storage account name is the first segment of the "Path" in Locator Creation Response after the pair of forward slashes and before ".blob.core.windows.net". Also, log into the portal and click on "Storage", locate the storage account associated with your AMS account, click on "Manage Keys" and it will show your storage account name
  - Replace the value of $accountKey with your STORAGE account key. Log into the portal and click on "Storage", locate the storage account associated with your AMS account, click on "Manage Keys" and it will show your storage account key (choose either the primary or the secondary key)
  - Replace the value of $resourcePath with your own - it is basically the URL from "Path" in Locator Creation Response. Drop everything from '?' onwards, just take the URL without query strings. Append "/" and then the name of the MP4 file (e.g., "/koushik.mp4" above)
  - Replace the value of $fileSize with the exact size of the MP4 file in bytes
  - Run it. It will print out 2 things - The UTC time and the signature. Copy the UTC time in both the "Date" and "x-ms-date" headers, and copy the signature into the Authorization header after the colon. You have to fire off the HTTP request within 15 minutes of generating the signature using the script, otherwise you will get a 4XX response

## Encode media file to a different format using built-in encoding presets:

}
]
}
```

###### Notes

1. 'Azure Media Encoder' is just one of several Media Processors available - it is the most basic encoding processor. There is a more advanced premium version of it - 'Media Encoder Premium Workflow'. All Media Processors available are listed and described [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-rest-get-media-processor/)
2. Not all Media Processors cannot do everything. In this example, I am going to encode an MP4 file to several bitrates of Smooth Format. This _can_ be done by the simplest of encoders - 'Azure Media Encoder'. Hence I am using this one. If you want to encode an Adobe F4V file to Smooth, this Media Processor would not be able to do that, as it does not accept F4V as input. [Here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-encode-asset/#compare_encoders) is a good comparison of the 2 most widely used media processors for encoding: 'Azure Media Encoder' and 'Media Encoder Premium Workflow'
3. This step is _like_ reserving your own encoding VM. Encoding is resource intensive. Hence for proper capacity management, reserving a media processor is required _before_ you can start encoding
4. The 'Id' field in the RESPONSE JSON gives the Media Processor's id - we will use it next when we actually submit an encoding job

#### Step 10 - Start an encoding job

###### Notes

1. In this example, we have submitted an asynchronous job (with 1 encoding task) to encode an input file to a set of output files.
2. In the REQUEST JSON payload, the "TaskBody" element accepts an embedded XML that specifies the input and output files. The "Tasks" element specifdies the Media Processor to use (we use the 'Id' we received from previous step 9) and the preset encoding profile to use for this task. We use 'H264 Smooth Streaming 720p'. The output bitrates and formats produced by this profile can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn619418.aspx). A list of all such task presets can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn619392.aspx)
3. It is possible to submit up to 30 parallel tasks in the same job. See [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-rest-encode-asset/#create-a-job-with-chained-tasks)
4. I was having trouble with this request, and finally resolved it by using Content-Type as 'application/json;odata=verbose', just 'application/json' was not working for API version 2.8 (API version 2.9 had other issues so I decided to stick to 2.8 if I could help it)
5. The 'Id' field in the RESPONSE JSON gives the Job's id - we will use it next when we monitor its status/ progress

###### Notes

1. As encoding job execution is asynchronous in Azure Media Services - as client you have to poll AMS for job status after submitting an encoding job. This example shows how to do that - we use the Job Id we receive in the previous step
2. An interesting point to note is the URL where we use OData specific query string filters ('$filter=').  AMS is fully OData compatible, and stores all REST objects as Entities
3. This part of the RESPONSE JSON gives us the job's status: "State": 3. 3 means finished (successfully). For all other values and meanings, see the 'State' property of the Job Entity [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/5100ddd7-92ff-4c37-84d2-4f84fee250a7#job_entity_properties)
4. Once the job finishes, I encourage you to switch to the Azure Portal and look at the Storage account associated with your AMS account - check out the list of blob containers. You will suddenly see a lot of them. One of them (the one which is named after your Job Id) has the output files produced by the encoding job (including the Smooth output files as well as the index/manifest required for adaptive playback). The others that are created as part of the encoding job are empty - they are most likely intermittent or temporary ones, or they could also be potential outputs that the selected profile did not create. I can check with the Product team if someone is curious

}
```

###### Notes

1. _Clear_ asset delivery policy is one that does not required encryption while delivering the Asset (as opposed to 'DynamicEnvelopeEncryption' or 'DynamicCommonEncryption' asset delivery policies) [This page](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-rest-configure-asset-delivery-policy/) shows how to use the other kinds of delivey policy as well
2. 'AssetDeliveryProtocol' - value of 7 indicates all three (Smooth, DASH and HLS) are allowed. Other combinations and values can be found [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-rest-configure-asset-delivery-policy/#types)
3. 'AssetDeliveryPolicyType' - value of 2 indicates clear policy. Other combinations and values can be found [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-rest-configure-asset-delivery-policy/#types)
4. The 'Id' field in the RESPONSE JSON gives the Asset Delivery Policies's id - we will use it next when we associate our Asset with this policy

###### Notes

1. As far as REST reource goes, this HTTP call is no different than one we made in Step 5, where we created access policy for _uploading_ content, here we created one for _downloading_ or _streaming_ content. In short, whenever we need to access Azure Storage Content from external world, we need a _Locator_ and in order to create a Locator, we need the correct kind of _Access Policy_
2. Note that the 'Permissions' field in REQUEST JSON has possible values of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 - please see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974297.aspx#accesspolicy_properties) for the API reference and all possible values/meanings. We are using '1' (= 'read') here because all we need to do for streaming content is _read_ it. In Step 5, we used '2' (= write) because we uploaded the file in that case
3. Note that the access policy will be in effect until it expires - and we specify the duration in minutes in the REQUEST JSON
4. Make a note of the 'Id' in the response. We will be using this when we refer to this access policy when we create the Locator next

#### Step 15 - Start the Streaming Endpoint With one or more Streaming Units

Do this in the portal --> go to Media Services and list your Media Services account, click on your account, go to "Streaming Endpoints"
Choose the "default" one, add Streaming Units to it (CAUTION: Costs Money) in the "Scale" tab
Start the Endpoint (Start at the bottom in the screen which lists all the endpoints for the account) if not running

#### Step 16 - Create a Locator of Type 2 ('OnDemandOrigin') for streaming content

###### Notes

1. This step is necessary to construct the actual streaming URL that we will use to upload our content file to AMS. The 'Path' element in the RESPONSE JSON will help us create the actual playback URL next
2. Note that in the REQUEST JSON, we are specifying the 'AccessPolicyId' from the 'Id' field in the response from Step 14, and 'AssetId' from the 'Id' field in the response from Step 3
3. Note that in the REQUEST JSON, we are specifying 'StartTime'. In order to avoid confusion, you can use UTC time and append a 'Z' to the time string - like this: "2015-05-17T22:00:00Z". Note that this can be (and should be, unless you have a reason to create a locator that you want to be activated in the future) a time in the past. If you use the exact current time, your locator may not be active until a few minutes, because Azure servers are not time-synced with your machine
4. Note that in the REQUEST JSON, we are specifying 'Type' as 2 - see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974308.aspx#locator_entity_properties) for all possible values and meanings. In short, use 1 for SAS type of locators, and use 2 for On Demand type of locators
5. The 'Id' field in the RESPONSE JSON gives the locator's id
6. We will use the 'Path' field in this RESPONSE JSON to construct the streaming URL next

#### Step 17 - Play your content back

  - Use this player: http://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/azuremediaplayer.html
  - Use the Path value returned after the creation of the locator to build the Smooth, HLS, and MPEG DASH URLs.
    - Smooth Streaming: Path + manifest file name + "/manifest"
    - DASH: Path + manifest file name + "/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)"
    - PDL: Path + asset file mp4 name
  - See section marked 'Build Streaming URLs' [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-rest-deliver-streaming-content/#create-an-ondemand-streaming-locator)

#### Step 18 - Deallocate resources

Deallocating/ deleting resources will help you save money, and should be built in as a best practice for developers in your organization. Thank you!
