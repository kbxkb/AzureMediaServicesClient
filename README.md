# AzureMediaServicesClient


REST based client for Azure Media Services showing HTTP requests and responses to ingest, encode, dynamically package and play content back

This README shows a series of REST HTTP requests and responses performed against the Azure Media Services using the Google Chrome app Postman. It walks you through the breadth of basic Azure Media Services functionality - create an account, ingest content, encode it to your desired format using a pre-defined encoding profile, dynamically package and deliver it to a player.

Because this is not *code* per se - just a series of HTTP requests and responses, there is no code file checked into this repository. This README has everything you would need.

DISCLAIMER: Azure Media Services is changing very fast. These samples may not work if you are looking at them sometime in the future. I will try to keep these updated, but I can make no guarantees.

DISCLAIMER: This is meant for guidance and demonstration only. This is not intended to be used in production as-is.
